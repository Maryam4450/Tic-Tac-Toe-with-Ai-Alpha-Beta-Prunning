# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe with Minimax & Alpha-Beta Pruning (Python)

This project is a console-based **Tic Tac Toe** game developed in **Python**, where the AI opponent uses:
- 🧠 **Minimax Algorithm**
- ⚡ **Alpha-Beta Pruning** (optimized Minimax)

Both algorithms are implemented in separate Python files, allowing you to explore, compare, and analyze their performance in decision-making.

## 🧠 Algorithms Overview

### 🔁 Minimax
Explores all possible future moves recursively to guarantee the best possible result for the AI.

### ⚡ Alpha-Beta Pruning
An optimization over Minimax that skips evaluating moves that cannot influence the final decision—making it significantly faster while maintaining optimality.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **User starts first**.
2. You will be prompted to **enter row and column numbers** for your move (e.g., `1 2`).
3. The **AI responds** with its optimal move.
4. The game continues until a **win** or a **draw** is detected.
5. After each AI move:
   - Number of **nodes explored**
   - **Time taken** in seconds  
   will be displayed in the console.
